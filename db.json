At an MSRP of over 100K Canadian, could this be the best performance bargain on sale? Does it render a Supra useless? For that matter, is it a supercar killer?",

      "description": "After nearly 60 years, the @Chevrolet #Corvette has FINALLY gone mid-engine for 2020. The all-new #C8Corvette broke the internet when it was announced last year and with a completely new chassis, quick-shifting 8-speed DCT, nearly 500 HP, and 0-60 in 2.9 seconds with the Z51 performance package, it will go down in history as the most impressive #ChevroletCorvette in history. The exotic car looks will get you attention everywhere and for those of you who want even more speed, Z06 and ZR1 versions are on the way in the next couple years. ",
